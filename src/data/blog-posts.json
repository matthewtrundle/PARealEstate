      "excerpt": "Buying a beach home in Texas has unique financing considerations. Learn about loan options, insurance requirements, and what lenders look for in coastal property purchases.",
      "content": "Financing a beach home differs from a traditional home purchase in several important ways. Here's what you need to know.\n\n## Loan Options\n\n### Conventional Loans\nMost buyers use conventional loans for beach home purchases. You'll typically need 10-20% down for a second home or investment property.\n\n### Jumbo Loans\nFor properties over the conforming loan limit (currently $766,550 in most Texas counties), you'll need a jumbo loan. These typically require higher down payments and better credit scores.\n\n### Portfolio Loans\nSome local lenders offer portfolio loans with more flexible terms, particularly for unique coastal properties.\n\n## Insurance Considerations\n\nLenders will require:\n- Homeowners insurance\n- Flood insurance (almost always required for coastal properties)\n- Windstorm insurance (separate policy in Texas)\n\nThese costs can add significantly to your monthly payment, so factor them into your budget.\n\n## What Lenders Look For\n\n- Strong credit score (typically 680+ for second homes)\n- Low debt-to-income ratio\n- Cash reserves (6+ months is common)\n- Proof of income and employment\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n1. Get pre-approved before you start looking\n2. Work with a lender experienced in coastal properties\n3. Budget for higher insurance costs\n4. Have reserves for maintenance and repairs",
